# claims-automation-script

Intercompany arbitration requires repetition such as creating folders to store claims data and creating uniform files for each claim in arb. I wrote a brief script to automate the process. 

Problem- Having to create a folder for each claim, numbering it accordingly and creating a file called (contentions.docx) for each individual claim on my list. 

Solution. 
The script takes a python list, iterates through it and for each item in the list creates a folder and places a word docx titled "contentions" inside the folder.
